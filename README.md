# Description

This application allows users to exter expenses and deposits to their budget. A ledger tracks each individual expense, and a total profit/loss is calculated and displayed at the top of the screen. This application can be used either online or offline, as all data and functions are stored in the browser's indexedDB. Offline expenses are stored as "pending", then added to the mongo database when the application comes back online.
